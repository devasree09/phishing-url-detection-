Phishing attacks are one of the most common online threats today, tricking users into sharing sensitive information through fake websites. Traditional detection methods like blacklists can’t always keep up especially with new, creative never seen URLs.

This project tackles the problem using a smart machine learning approach. By combining the strengths of XGBoost and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) through a soft voting ensemble, we build a model that's both accurate and adaptable. 
It captures both structured and complex patterns in URLs, helping detect phishing attempts that are sneaky.

 Result analysis:
 1.Multi-class URL classification (Phishing, Legitimate, Suspicious, etc.)
 2.Hybrid model: XGBoost + ANN
 3.Real-time URL prediction support
 4.Clean, modular Python code
 5.Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
